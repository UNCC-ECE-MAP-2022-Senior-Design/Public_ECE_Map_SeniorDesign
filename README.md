This project is a property of *Unversity of North Carolina at Charlotte Electrical and Computer Engineering Deparment*
#### Company and Project Overview: 
> This project will be developed in the Control Systems and Autonomous Robots (CSAR) lab in the Electrical
and Computer Engineering Department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte under the supervision
of the Principal Investigator (PI) Dipankar Maity. In this project, the students are required to develop a
robotic autonomous delivery system for UNCC campus where robots will be autonomously dispatched
from one location of the campus to go to another location while carrying light-weight materials such as books,
mails, small packages etc. This project will be done in two phases. Phase-1 with a senior design team will
consist of designing a (GPS-enabled) campus navigation system which will produce a planned path for the
robots to go from any campus location to any other location. The second phase, which will be build upon the
development of this phase, will be on the implementation of the algorithms into real robots.
